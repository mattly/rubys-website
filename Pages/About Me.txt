Ruby Barmes | she/her 

Ruby is a big nerd who loves to listen to read books, dig around in the garden, play D&D and listen to podcasts. 

Ruby works in 3 distinct mediums â€“ acrylic painting for her Fine Art, digital art for her Fanart, and pen and ink for her Inktober works.   

Ruby is the proud mother of two cats: Noodle and Toast.  

Noodle is an accomplished emotional support animal with a long career of valuable service. Toast is from the streets and has the very necessary job of determining dinnertime and treat-time (always).
